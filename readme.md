# Project 2
## Daily workout plan with nutrition facts and gym locator.

# App Description
This app will allow users to create, update and delete routines for
a daily workout plan. There will be different workouts for the seven 
days in the week. They also will be able to track how many calories 
they burn per day. I would like to include a gym and food store locator
API so the user can search for nearby places.  

# Tables
Create table for differnt days of the week. Add a workout table.
Joined table to display on the page. Separate into two tables.
